# making subgraphs for tracking defi pulse portfolio 
# : an advanced tutorial for using theGraph


### credits to MelonPort for the example.


## Context : 
the graph is the most  innovative idea in the publicvally onchain signals for the defi signals and giving people the power to define the API's in more modular way .

## Idea :

1. Providing the  diffrent liquidity pools information schema list from the defipulse , and then based on the  current investment  exchange , gives the relative TVL growth wrt the other pools . 

2. also supporting  auditing the transaction swaps between the diffrent pools to have more detailed information 

## Schema approx description (WIP) :

User can be asked about : address , exchange , particular transactionID  . then idea is to develop the specification code in the context.ts and entities for describing the use case .


TODO: check the examples of the standard pool protocols on theGraph
